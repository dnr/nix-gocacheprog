# nix-gocacheprog

**Use Go build caching inside Nix builds**

Go build and tool caching is great, but it doesn't work in Nix builds because of
the sandbox.

`nix-gocacheprog` pokes a hole in the sandbox to make it work. Iterating on Go
builds in Nix is fast again!

Note: We're talking about the build cache here (object files and binaries), not
the module cache (dependencies' source code). The existing tools handle
dependencies fairly well.

Also note: Only do this if you trust that Go's build cache is accurate (this
seems pretty well-accepted). Maybe don't do it on your release builds.

This is just single-machine caching, nothing over the network yet.

Only for NixOS for now, but it shouldn't be that hard to make it work on other
systems that Nix runs on (contributions welcome).


## Usage

- Import [module.nix](module.nix) in your NixOS config.
- Add [overlay.nix](overlay.nix) to your NixOS config or to your project.
- For Go 1.21 through 1.23:
  - Use `buildGo122ModuleCached` instead of `buildGo122Module`
- For Go 1.24+, _either_:
  - Use `buildGo124ModuleCached` instead of `buildGo124Module`
  - Add `nixGocacheprogHook` to your `nativeBuildInputs`.

### Example

(You'll probably want to use flakes or niv or npins or whatever, but this should
give you the idea.)

**`configuration.nix`**
```nix
{
  imports = [
    "${fetchTarball "https://github.com/dnr/nix-gocacheprog/archive/main.tar.gz"}/module.nix"
  ];
}
```

**`myproject/default.nix`**
```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> { config = {}; overlays = [
  (import "${fetchTarball "https://github.com/dnr/nix-gocacheprog/archive/main.tar.gz"}/overlay.nix")
]; } }:
let
  # This lets it work even if the attribute is missing:
  buildGoModule = pkgs.buildGo123ModuleCached or pkgs.buildGo123Module;
in
buildGoModule {
  pname = "myproject";
  version = "0.0.11";
  vendorHash = null;
  src = pkgs.lib.cleanSource ./.;
  subPackages = [ "cmd/myproject" ];
}
```

## How does it work?

### GOCACHEPROG

`GOCACHEPROG` is an experimental Go feature that will be promoted to stable with Go 1.24.
It lets you plug in an external program to handle the Go build cache.
There's a "reference implemention" of the protocol here: https://github.com/bradfitz/go-tool-cache

### Sandbox and pre-build-hook

We can plug in a program but how do we share the cache across builds?
We poke a hole using Nix's `pre-build-hook`:
Nix runs a program of our choice before setting up the sandbox, and it can add
specific paths to the sandbox (with bind mounts).

So we just add the whole Go build cache, right?

Well, no. That would work but it would be a big mess, with multiple uids writing
to one directory, that could read each other's filesâ€¦

We add:
- Our `GOCACHEPROG` binary.
- A unix socket, for our `GOCACHEPROG` to communicate over.
- A build-specific directory to put the cached files in (this is why it needs to
  be a pre-build-hook and not just extra-sandbox-paths).

The other end of the socket is a daemon that runs on the host, that speaks the
`GOCACHEPROG` protocol with extensions for setting up build-specific
directories. The cache itself is shared among all builds on the system, but each
build can only see its own files (files that it knows the input hash of).

### Module and overlay

The module sets `pre-build-hook`, sets up the daemon, and adds a nixpkgs overlay
to expose the modified builders.

The overlay sets up:

- Variants of `go_1_21`, `go_1_22`, and `go_1_23` built with `GOEXPERIMENT=cacheprog`.
- `nixGocacheprogHook` that you can add to `nativeBuildInputs`.
- `buildGo121ModuleCached` (and 122 and 123) that work like `buildGo121Module` but:
  - Use the experiment Go build.
  - Automatically add `nixGocacheprogHook` to `nativeBuildInputs`.


## TODO

- Prune the cache sometimes
- Flake (contributions welcome)
- Extend over the network
- Make it work with `sandbox = false` (see [this issue](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/2985))
- Make it work with non-NixOS systems
- Think about the module cache also


## Comparisons

### https://github.com/numtide/build-go-cache

`build-go-cache` takes a different approach: it pre-builds dependencies and puts
them in a separate derivation that is a dependency of your build.

Some differences:

`build-go-cache`
- is more pure
- only caches dependency builds
- requires an extra step to list external packages and an extra file in the repo
- works anywhere

`nix-gocacheprog`
- should provide more speedup
- caches build results of the main project also
- caches everything including test runs
- after Go 1.24, will cache binary linking results also
- requires system-level changes (`pre-build-hook`)
- is technically impure, but we generally trust the Go build tool
- is only set up for NixOS right now, but should work elsewhere with a little effort
